# Info
Can generate 10M codes in 5 seconds, yeah... crazy


# Setup
Download dotnet core, and open the terminal to the containing folder of the program

Run ``dotnet build``, and when it is finished a file should be created in one of the folders called ``NitroGenSharp.exe``.

This also supports linux (I made it on linux) so it should run fine.
